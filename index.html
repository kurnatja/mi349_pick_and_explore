            JavaScript is a tool that can be utilized for many different purposes in web development and design. It can be used to design complex features in your website, and it helps to make them functional for the purpose you are designing them for. JavaScript is used for basically everything outside of when your webpage just sits there and displays information.</p>
           <p>
            Advanced JavaScript can be utilized for a variety of functional purposes. With it, you can animate aunty images in your webpage, dynamically update content, control multimedia, and more (Mozilla, 2020). JavaScript falls more on the programming side of web design than the design side, so it is mainly used for actions you want your webpage to do. For example, if you want your user to be able to enter a name for themselves, you can create a JavaScript element that will store the name entered by the user as a variable.</p>
           <p>
            Additionally, there are other useful JavaScript features such as APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that basically serve as ready-to-go building blocks for JavaScript code, like code libraries. These APIs make it much easier to find the function you need and plug it into your code rather than tediously going through and coding each element yourself while working out the errors along the way. APIs fall under two different categories: Browser and Third Party. Browser APIs are embedded in the web browser, while Third Party APIs are to be found elsewhere.</p>
          
            <p>Overall, JavaScript can be utilized in many different ways for the functionality of your webpage.</p>
